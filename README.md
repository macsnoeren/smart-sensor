# SmartSensor
Another smart sensor? Yes ... finally ... a smart sensor developed for students and research projects within the context of the energy transition. You could do much more with this hardware of course. That is up to you! For us, we have several goals in mind concerning education and research, namely:
1. Education in the area of
  1. Embedded hardware
  2. Internet-of-things
  3. Mesh networking
  4. Security
2. Research within the field of energy transition by means of
  1. Data acquisition of measurements within buildings
  2. Real-time measurements in buildings (most buildings do not have enough measurements)
  3. Real-time control and interfacing with building installations

Furthermore, the SmartSensor is also used for research in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics.

# Living lab
The SmartSensor evolves during time. Students and researches improve the hardware and software of the sensor.
